# TipTap Collaborative Editor - Railway Deployment Next Steps

## Context
We've created a comprehensive implementation for deploying the TipTap Collaborative Editor on Railway, including both the WebSocket server and frontend. All files have been prepared, and we're ready to execute the deployment and perform final testing.

## Current Status
- All implementation files are created and committed
- Local testing script is available for verification
- Deployment script is ready for execution
- Documentation is complete

## Next Session Objectives
1. Execute the Railway deployment
2. Verify both services are running correctly
3. Test collaborative editing in the production environment
4. Prepare for the Wordware demonstration
5. Address any issues discovered during deployment

## Key Files
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/deploy-to-railway.sh` - Deployment script
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/RailwayEnhancedWebSocketServer.cjs` - WebSocket server
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/railway-websocket.json` - WebSocket configuration
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/railway-frontend.json` - Frontend configuration
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/src/RailwayApp.tsx` - Main application component
- `~/Workspace/tiptap-demo/src/context/RailwayCollaborationContext.tsx` - Connection management

## Questions to Explore
1. How does the deployed WebSocket server perform under load?
2. What metrics should we capture for monitoring?
3. How can we implement persistent document storage?
4. What authentication mechanisms would work best for our use case?
5. How should we structure the Wordware demonstration?

## Specific Tasks
1. Execute the deployment script: `./deploy-to-railway.sh`
2. Test collaboration between multiple users
3. Verify room-based collaboration with different URLs
4. Test connection resilience (network interruptions, etc.)
5. Create a demonstration script for Wordware

## Technical Demonstrations
1. Show how users in different browser windows have unique identities
2. Demonstrate real-time cursor tracking
3. Show the connection status dashboard in action
4. Demonstrate recovery from connection interruptions
5. Show room creation and sharing capabilities

Let's proceed with the deployment and final verification of our Railway implementation for the TipTap Collaborative Editor!
