# TipTap Collaborative Editor - Deployment Solution

This document outlines the comprehensive solution implemented to address the deployment challenges with the TipTap collaborative editor project.

## 1. WebSocket Connection Fix

### Problem
The frontend deployed on Vercel was attempting to connect to `ws://localhost:8080` instead of the Railway WebSocket server at `wss://tiptap-demo-production.up.railway.app`.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Enhanced WebSocketService.ts**
   - Updated the WebSocket URL resolution logic to use multiple fallback strategies
   - Added environment variable priority: `VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL` → `VITE_WEBSOCKET_PRIMARY_URL` → auto-detection
   - Implemented protocol detection (ws:// vs wss://) based on secure context
   - Added detailed logging and debugging capabilities

2. **ConnectionStatus Component**
   - Created a new ConnectionStatus.tsx component to visualize WebSocket connection state
   - Provides real-time feedback on connection status with visual indicators
   - Includes debugging tools for troubleshooting connection issues

3. **App.tsx Updates**
   - Updated the WebSocket URL definition to use the new resolution logic
   - Added the ConnectionStatus component to the UI when collaboration is enabled

4. **Environment Variable Handling**
   - Enhanced the logic to properly handle environment variables in different contexts
   - Added development-specific debugging for environment variable visibility

## 2. Railway Deployment Configuration

### Problem
The project needed a more streamlined deployment process with better coordination between the frontend and WebSocket server.

### Solution Implemented

1. **Railway Configuration Files**
   - Created `frontend-railway.json` for frontend service configuration
   - Created `websocket-railway.json` for WebSocket server configuration
   - Configured health checks and restart policies

2. **WebSocket Server Enhancement**
   - Added a dedicated health endpoint for monitoring
   - Implemented proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
   - Enhanced error handling for connection issues
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   - Created `deploy-all.sh` for coordinated deployment of both services
   - Implemented environment variable propagation between services
   - Added validation with `validate-env.sh` to prevent deployment issues
   - Created `collect-logs.sh` for troubleshooting production deployments

## 3. Testing and Verification Workflow

### Problem
There was no systematic approach to testing the collaborative features after deployment.

### Solution

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Created `validate-env.sh` to verify environment variables before deployment
   - Checks for required variables and validates format and protocol
   - Tests WebSocket connectivity when possible

2. **Log Collection**
   - Implemented `collect-logs.sh` for gathering deployment logs
   - Collects logs from both services for comprehensive troubleshooting
   - Checks environment variables and configuration files
   - Tests WebSocket connectivity

## 4. Documentation Updates

1. **Memory Bank**
   - Created this comprehensive deployment solution document
   - Documented all changes and implementation details
   - Provided rationale for architectural decisions

2. **Code Documentation**
   - Added detailed comments to WebSocketService.ts
   - Documented the connection handling logic
   - Added clear error messages and logging

## 5. Railway Deployment Guide

Here's a step-by-step guide for deploying both the frontend and WebSocket server to Railway:

### Prerequisites
- Railway account and CLI installed (`npm i -g @railway/cli`)
- Project code in a clean state and ready for deployment

### Deployment Steps

1. **Set Up Railway Project**
   ```bash
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Create new project (if needed)
   railway init tiptap-collaborative-editor
   ```

2. **Deploy WebSocket Server First**
   ```bash
   # Ensure WebSocket configuration is active
   cp websocket-railway.json railway.json
   
   # Deploy to Railway
   railway up --detach
   
   # Get the deployed domain
   WS_URL=$(railway domain)
   echo "WebSocket server deployed at: wss://$WS_URL"
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file with WebSocket URL
   cat > .env.production << EOF
   VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://$WS_URL
   VITE_WEBSOCKET_PRIMARY_URL=wss://$WS_URL
   VITE_APP_TITLE=TipTap Collaborative Editor
   ENABLE_COLLABORATION=true
   EOF
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend**
   ```bash
   # Build frontend with updated environment variables
   npm run build
   
   # Switch to frontend configuration
   cp frontend-railway.json railway.json
   
   # Deploy frontend to Railway
   railway up --detach
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check frontend URL
   FRONTEND_URL=$(railway domain)
   echo "Frontend deployed at: https://$FRONTEND_URL"
   
   # Test WebSocket connection
   ./validate-env.sh
   ```

### Alternative: Automated Deployment

To run the entire deployment process automatically, use the provided script:

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy-all.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy-all.sh
```

## 6. Troubleshooting Guide

### Connection Issues

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL is set correctly in .env.production
   - Ensure it uses wss:// protocol for production

2. **Check WebSocket Server Health**
   - Visit https://[websocket-url]/health
   - Verify server is running and returning status information

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors in console
   - Enable the ConnectionStatus component for visual feedback

4. **Collect Logs**
   - Run ./collect-logs.sh
   - Examine logs for errors or connection issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Verify WebSocket server is configured with proper CORS headers
   - Check browser console for CORS-related errors

2. **Mixed Content Warnings**
   - Ensure using wss:// protocol when frontend is on https://
   - Check for blocked mixed content in browser console

3. **Connection Timeouts**
   - Verify WebSocket server is running and accessible
   - Check for network issues or firewall blocks

## 7. Future Improvements

1. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployments
   - Add deployment verification tests

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Implement detailed metrics for WebSocket connections
   - Add alerting for connection issues

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - Enhance offline capabilities when WebSocket is unavailable
   - Implement more robust reconnection strategies
