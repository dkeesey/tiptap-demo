2. **Engineers evaluating need**: Demonstration of code quality, component architecture, and understanding of complex UI frameworks.
   
3. **Product managers need**: Proof of ability to build intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that align with product vision.

## Market Context
Wordware recently raised $30 million in seed funding to build an AI development platform that allows users to create AI applications using natural language rather than traditional coding. They use TipTap as part of their collaborative editing environment, particularly for working with AI prompts.
