# TipTap Demo - Active Context

## Current Focus
As of April 29, 2025, the active focus is on:
1. Synchronizing deployed versions with latest development build
2. Resolving WebSocket connectivity issues in production
3. Documenting technical challenges and solutions for portfolio
4. Creating comprehensive architecture documentation
5. Improving deployment workflow between Vercel and Railway

## Recent Changes
- Documented deployment challenges and solutions (April 29, 2025)
- Created portfolio case study (April 29, 2025)
- Enhanced project README for portfolio presentation (April 29, 2025)
- Added technical architecture documentation (April 29, 2025)
- Documented technical challenges with WebSocket connectivity (April 29, 2025)
- Created deployment script (April 29, 2025)
- Enhanced micro-interactions utility with additional animations and effects (April 27, 2025)
- Implemented browser-level console filtering (April 27, 2025)
- Fixed bubble menu persistence issue (April 27, 2025)
- Completely disabled Y.js internal logging (April 27, 2025)
- Applied extreme logging reduction (April 27, 2025)
- Fixed WebSocket connectivity issues (April 27, 2025)

## Current Priorities
1. **P0**: Synchronize Vercel deployment with latest fixes
2. **P0**: Configure WebSocket environment variables correctly in production
3. **P0**: Test collaborative features in production environment
4. **P1**: Simplify deployment process for future updates
5. **P2**: Consider consolidating frontend and WebSocket server on Railway

## In-Progress Tasks
- Synchronizing deployed versions with latest development build
- Resolving WebSocket connectivity issues in production
- Testing collaborative editing features in production

## Upcoming Tasks
- Create simplified deployment process for future updates
- Consider consolidating frontend and WebSocket server on Railway
- Conduct final cross-browser testing

## Blockers and Challenges
- Environment variable configuration issues in Vercel
- WebSocket URL configuration not propagating to production build
- Potential CORS issues between Vercel and Railway services

## Current Questions
- Is it more efficient to deploy both frontend and WebSocket server on Railway?
- What additional logging or error handling could help diagnose WebSocket issues?
- What steps can be automated in the deployment process?

## Recent Learnings
- Vercel environment variables require specific formatting and handling
- Multiple service deployments need careful coordination
- WebSocket connections in production have different requirements than local development
- Deployment scripts need comprehensive error handling and verification
- Environment variables should be verified after deployment
