# Post-Presentation Deployment Guide

## Overview
After the presentation to the Wordware recruiter, several issues were identified and fixed:

1. **WebSocket Connectivity Issues**
   - Fixed port mismatch between client and server
   - Added proper protocol constants
   - Implemented logging reduction
   - Enhanced connection handling and error resilience

2. **Tailwind CSS Version Management**
   - Locked Tailwind CSS to v3.3.2 to prevent version conflicts
   - Updated configuration for consistency across environments

## Deployment Process
1. Fixed issues locally and tested thoroughly
2. Committed changes to the GitHub repository
3. Deployed WebSocket server to Railway
4. Updated environment variables in Vercel
5. Deployed frontend to Vercel
6. Verified functionality across both deployments

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Commit Local Changes

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/Workspace/tiptap-demo

# Add all changed files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix WebSocket connectivity issues and stabilize Tailwind CSS version"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy WebSocket Server to Railway

```bash
# Deploy using Railway CLI
cd ~/Workspace/tiptap-demo
railway up --service websocket-server

# Verify deployment
railway status
railway domain
```

### 3. Update Environment Variables in Vercel

```bash
# Add/update WebSocket URL environment variable
vercel env add VITE_WEBSOCKET_PRIMARY_URL wss://tiptap-demo-production.up.railway.app
```

### 4. Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
# Deploy to production
cd ~/Workspace/tiptap-demo
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Verify Functionality

1. Open https://tiptap-demo-chi.vercel.app in two browser windows
2. Test collaborative editing functionality
3. Check for WebSocket connection issues in the browser console
4. Verify that the UI enhancements display correctly

## WebSocket Architecture

The collaborative editing feature uses a multi-tier architecture:
- Frontend React application using TipTap and Y.js
- WebSocket server deployed on Railway
- Public WebSocket URL accessible to all collaborators
- Fallback to WebRTC when direct WebSocket connection fails

## Troubleshooting Guide

### WebSocket Connection Issues

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify that `VITE_WEBSOCKET_PRIMARY_URL` is set correctly in Vercel
   - Ensure the URL uses `wss://` protocol (secure WebSockets)

2. **Check WebSocket Server Status**
   ```bash
   railway status
   ```

3. **Verify Network Connectivity**
   - Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
   - Test direct connection to WebSocket URL using a tool like wscat:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wscat
   wscat -c wss://tiptap-demo-production.up.railway.app
   ```

4. **Debug Log Analysis**
   - Check Railway logs for connection issues:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

### Tailwind CSS Issues

1. **Check Version Consistency**
   - Verify package.json has the correct Tailwind CSS version (3.3.2)
   - Check for version conflicts in package-lock.json

2. **Verify Configuration**
   - Ensure tailwind.config.js is using compatible syntax
   - Check for any v4-specific features that may cause issues

3. **CSS Build Verification**
   - Rebuild CSS files locally and check for errors:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Configuration Management**
   - Keep environment variables consistent across development and production
   - Use specific version locks for critical dependencies
   - Document all connection parameters for future reference

2. **Cross-Environment Testing**
   - Test collaboration features across multiple devices and browsers
   - Verify WebSocket connections with network monitoring tools
   - Check console logs for connection issues

3. **Deployment Synchronization**
   - Ensure both frontend and WebSocket server deployments are kept in sync
   - Update documentation when deployment URLs or configurations change
   - Maintain a clear deployment history for troubleshooting
