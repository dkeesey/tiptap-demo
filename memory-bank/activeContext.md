## Current Priorities
1. **P0**: Complete consolidated Railway deployment of both frontend and WebSocket server
2. **P0**: Test collaborative features in production environment
3. **P0**: Finalize portfolio documentation with deployment architecture 
4. **P1**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for WebSocket connections
5. **P2**: Enhance offline fallback capabilities

## In-Progress Tasks
- Testing collaborative editing features
- Testing AI features implementation
- Final UI polish
- Creating presentation material for recruiter

## Upcoming Tasks
- Conduct cross-browser testing
- Prepare final project presentation
- Rehearse demo for Monday meeting with recruiter

## Blockers and Challenges
- ~~WebSocket connectivity issues~~ (Resolved April 29, 2025)
- ~~Environment variable propagation~~ (Resolved April 29, 2025)
- None at this time

## Current Questions
- Would a fully consolidated Railway deployment be more maintainable than the hybrid Vercel/Railway approach?
- What additional monitoring metrics would be valuable for tracking WebSocket performance?
- What CI/CD workflow would be most effective for synchronized deployment of both services?
- How can we further optimize the reconnection experience for intermittent network conditions?

## Recent Learnings
- Railway provides an effective platform for both frontend and WebSocket server deployment
- WebSocket connections require secure protocol (wss://) when used with HTTPS frontends
- Environment variables must be carefully managed across deployment platforms
- Health endpoints are essential for monitoring WebSocket server status
- Proper CORS configuration is critical for cross-origin WebSocket connections
- Dynamic WebSocket URL resolution improves deployment flexibility
- Coordinated deployment scripts ensure synchronization between services
- Visual connection status indicators greatly improve debugging and user experience
- Detailed logging helps identify and resolve WebSocket connection issues
- Y.js providers need additional error handling for production reliability
- TipTap's extension system is powerful and modular
- Y.js provides robust real-time collaboration capabilities
- TipTap's collaborative cursor extension works well with Y.js
- The slash command interface can be implemented using TipTap's suggestion API
- WebSocket providers need careful management for connection handling
- User presence can be effectively managed through Y.js awareness
- Connection status indicators are important for user experience
- TipTap's headless architecture allows for complete UI customization
- Offline-first approach is possible with Y.js's CRDT capabilities
- Custom node extensions provide powerful ways to extend the editor
