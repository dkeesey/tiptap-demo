## In-Progress Tasks
- Implementing custom nodes for AI prompts
- Enhancing slash command interface with more options
- Testing collaborative editing features

## Upcoming Tasks
- Implement additional slash commands for AI-specific blocks
- Add more UI polish for Notion-like appearance
- Complete final testing and bug fixes before presentation

## Blockers and Challenges
- None at this time

## Current Questions
- What's the best approach for implementing custom AI prompt nodes?
- How can we enhance the offline experience for collaborative editing?
- How should we structure the slash command interface for optimal UX?

## Recent Learnings
