## Current Priorities
1. **P0**: Implement core collaboration infrastructure with Y.js
2. **P0**: Create collaborative cursor and user presence features
3. **P0**: Develop slash command interface for Notion-like UX
4. **P1**: Add AI prompt-specific components
5. **P2**: Enhance UI to better match Wordware's implementation

## In-Progress Tasks
- Setting up Y.js and WebSocket infrastructure for collaboration
- Creating React context for collaboration state management
- Integrating TipTap collaboration extensions

## Upcoming Tasks
- Implement user presence indicators
- Add slash command interface
- Create custom nodes for AI prompts
- Enhance UI for Notion-like experience

## Blockers and Challenges
- None at this time

## Current Questions
- What's the best approach for deploying the WebSocket server alongside our app?
- How can we optimize the offline experience for collaborative editing?
- What's the best way to structure custom AI prompt nodes?

## Recent Learnings
- TipTap's extension system is powerful and modular
- The editor requires three key components: editor, toolbar, and menus
- Document persistence can be easily implemented with localStorage
- The headless nature of TipTap allows for complete UI customization
- Tailwind Typography plugin is essential for proper rich text styling
- TipTap uses a component-based architecture with intuitive UI elements
- Wordware uses TipTap specifically for collaborative editing of AI prompts
- The editor's state can be queried to determine active formatting
- Extensions can be configured with options to customize behavior
- Converting to and from Markdown requires careful handling of formatting
- TipTap's headless architecture makes implementing custom UI straightforward
- Wordware uses Y.js as their CRDT for collaborative editing
- They use SyncedStore as a wrapper around Y.Doc for easier state management
- PartyKit serves as their collaboration backend
- They implement a Notion-like slash command interface for adding blocks
- Their implementation follows an offline-first approach for resilience

## Active Branches and Changes
- Main branch: Complete implementation with markdown support and collaborative features plan

## Deployment Status
- Ready for deployment on Vercel
