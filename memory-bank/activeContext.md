## Current Priorities
1. **P0**: Test the initial implementation to ensure all basic features work
2. **P0**: Set up GitHub repository
3. **P0**: Deploy initial version to Vercel
4. **P1**: Implement additional Phase 2 features (markdown import/export)
5. **P2**: Consider Phase 3 features (collaborative editing)

## In-Progress Tasks
- Initial implementation of TipTap editor with essential components
- Setting up deployment pipeline

## Upcoming Tasks
- Test editor functionality across browsers
- Set up GitHub repository
- Configure Vercel deployment
- Implement markdown import/export features
- Consider adding collaborative editing features if time permits

## Blockers and Challenges
- Styling issues that require additional Tailwind plugins (resolved with Typography plugin)
- Local testing to ensure editor works as expected
- GitHub repository setup
- Vercel deployment configuration

## Current Questions
