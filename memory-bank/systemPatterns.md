# TipTap Demo - System Architecture and Patterns

## High-Level Architecture

The TipTap demo will follow a modern, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
1. **Editor Core**: Central TipTap editor instance and configuration
2. **UI Layer**: React components for the user interface
3. **Extension Layer**: TipTap extensions for added functionality
4. **State Management**: Document state and persistence
5. **Optional: Collaboration Layer**: For real-time collaboration features
6. **Optional: AI Integration**: For AI-assisted editing features

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: State flows down from parent components while events flow up
2. **Editor State Management**: TipTap's internal state management for the document
3. **Local Storage Integration**: For document persistence
4. **Optional: CRDT-based Sync**: For collaborative editing

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Editor Foundation
- **TipTap as Headless Framework**: Using TipTap as the core editing framework while implementing custom UI
- **React Integration**: Using @tiptap/react for seamless integration with React components
- **Extension-Based Architecture**: Leveraging TipTap's extension system for modular functionality

### UI Implementation
- **Clean Component Hierarchy**: Well-defined component structure with clear responsibilities
- **Headless UI Pattern**: Following TipTap's headless approach for maximum flexibility
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring good experience across devices

### State Management
- **Editor Context**: Using React context for editor state where appropriate
- **Local Storage**: For document persistence between sessions
- **URL-based Sharing**: For sharing documents via URLs

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtualization**: For handling large documents efficiently
- **Debounced Updates**: For expensive operations like saving to storage
- **Lazy-loading Extensions**: Loading extensions only when needed

## Technical Debt Considerations

1. **Extension Management**: Careful management of extension dependencies to avoid conflicts
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Testing across browsers to ensure consistent behavior
3. **Performance with Large Documents**: Monitoring and optimizing for large document performance

## Infrastructure Design

### Development Infrastructure
- **Create React App**: For quick setup and standardized tooling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **ESLint & Prettier**: For code quality and consistent formatting

### Deployment Infrastructure
- **Vercel/Netlify**: For simple, continuous deployment
- **GitHub**: For version control and CI/CD integration
- **Optional: Backend for Collaboration**: If implementing collaborative features

## Scalability Considerations

While this is a demo project, the architecture will be designed with scalability in mind:

1. **Modular Components**: Components designed for reusability and composability
2. **Extension-First Approach**: Leveraging TipTap's extension system for maintainable feature growth
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implementing best practices for editor performance

## Future-Proofing

1. **Clean Abstractions**: Isolating third-party dependencies behind interfaces
2. **Modern Tooling**: Using current best practices and tools
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of architecture and decisions
