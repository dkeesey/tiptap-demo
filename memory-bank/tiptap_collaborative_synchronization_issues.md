# TipTap Collaborative Editor Synchronization Issues

## Current Issues Identified

1. **Same User Identity Across Multiple Windows**
   - Multiple browser windows are showing the same user identity (e.g., "User 6")
   - Each browser window should generate a unique identity with different colors
   - Likely issue with the user ID generation and persistence logic

2. **Document Synchronization Failure**
   - Changes made in one window are not appearing in other windows
   - Both windows show connected status despite lack of synchronization
   - WebSocket communication appears established but data not flowing properly

3. **Y.js Integration Problems**
   - Y.js document updates not properly propagating between clients
   - Awareness information (user presence) not reflecting correctly
   - Provider connection showing success but document changes not synchronizing

## Root Causes to Investigate

1. **User Identity Generation**
   - Current implementation in CollaborationContext.tsx likely using same source for ID
   - LocalStorage persistence may be causing shared identity across windows
   - Session-specific uniqueness not being enforced

2. **WebSocket Provider Configuration**
   - Connection established but update messages not being processed
   - Event handlers for document updates possibly incomplete
   - Provider awareness features not configured correctly

3. **Y.js Document Structure**
   - Document fragment possibly not shared correctly between instances
   - Improper initialization of shared document structure
   - Missing update event propagation

## Technical Learnings

1. **Y.js Architecture**
   - Requires proper document structure initialization
   - Needs awareness configuration for user presence
   - Relies on correctly configured WebSocket provider for updates

2. **Collaborative Editing Patterns**
   - User identity must be unique per browser instance
   - Document synchronization requires bidirectional update flow
   - Connection status must reflect actual document sync state

3. **Browser Storage Considerations**
   - LocalStorage is shared across browser tabs/windows
   - SessionStorage is needed for tab/window-specific data
   - Hybrid approach required for persistent user info with session-specific IDs

## Next Steps

1. Implement unique user identity generation across browser instances
2. Fix Y.js document synchronization between connected clients
3. Properly configure awareness features for cursor tracking
4. Add comprehensive debugging and status reporting
5. Create test scenarios to verify fixes across multiple scenarios
