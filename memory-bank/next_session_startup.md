## Current Context
We are working on refining the TipTap editor's UI and interaction mechanisms, specifically focusing on:
- Bubble menu behavior
- Micro-interactions
- Responsive design improvements

## Specific Focus Areas
1. Complete bubble menu visibility debugging
2. Implement comprehensive logging for editor interactions
3. Enhance micro-interaction utilities
4. Review and optimize TipTap extension configurations

## Immediate Action Items
- Review console logs from bubble menu debugging
- Finalize `shouldShow` method implementation
- Test edge cases in selection and formatting
- Document observed behavior patterns

## Technical Stack
- TipTap Editor
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Y.js for collaboration
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet for AI-assisted development

## Startup Command Sequence
1. Restart WebSocket server
2. Start development server
3. Open browser with developer tools
4. Verify console logging functionality
5. Test editor interactions systematically

## Collaboration Notes
- Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- Continued focus on incremental, testable improvements
- Maintain detailed documentation of changes and learnings

## Questions to Investigate
- Are there any remaining unexpected behaviors in the bubble menu?
- How can we make the selection detection more robust?
- What additional context can we add to improve logging?

Let's continue our systematic approach to refining the TipTap editor's user experience.
