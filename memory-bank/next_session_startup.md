# Next Session Deployment Focus for TipTap Collaborative Editor

## Current Project State
- Simplified WebSocket collaboration implementation
- Minimal deployment configuration
- Using public WebSocket service as fallback

## Deployment Objectives
1. **Validate Vercel Deployment**
   - Confirm successful build and hosting
   - Verify WebSocket connection works
   - Test basic collaborative editing functionality

2. **WebSocket Connection Strategies**
   - Validate fallback connection mechanism
   - Implement more robust error handling
   - Create user-friendly connection status indicators

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for WebSocket URL
   - Create development vs. production configurations
   - Ensure seamless switching between connection modes

## Specific Tasks
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel with GitHub repository
- [ ] Configure WebSocket URL environment variable
- [ ] Test collaborative editing across different browsers
- [ ] Implement comprehensive connection status UI
- [ ] Create fallback mechanism for WebSocket connection failure

## Potential Challenges to Address
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Handling intermittent network connections
- Providing clear user feedback during connection issues

## Recommended Approach
1. Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Deployment
2. Iterative Testing and Improvement
3. Focus on User Experience
4. Robust Error Handling

## Key Questions to Investigate
- How reliable is the public WebSocket service?
- What are the performance characteristics of the current implementation?
- How can we improve user experience during connection issues?

PROMPT FOR CLAUDE HAIKU:
Objective: Shepherd the TipTap Collaborative Editor to a working Vercel deployment.

Context:
- Project is a real-time collaborative editor using TipTap and Y.js
- Currently using a public WebSocket service (y-webrtc-signal-backend.fly.dev)
- Need to validate and improve deployment process

Immediate Actions:
1. Verify project builds successfully
2. Create GitHub repository if not existing
3. Connect repository to Vercel
4. Configure WebSocket URL environment variable
5. Test collaborative editing functionality
6. Implement comprehensive error handling and connection status UI

Focus Areas:
- Deployment simplicity
- Fallback connection mechanisms
- User experience during connection state changes

Constraints:
- Minimize complexity
- Use existing public WebSocket service
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility

Reporting:
- Provide detailed steps taken
- Document any challenges encountered
- Suggest improvements for future iterations

Begin by reviewing the current project configuration and preparing for deployment.
