# TipTap Collaborative Editor - Railway Deployment Learnings

## Deployment Challenges and Solutions

### Railway CLI Evolution
- The Railway CLI has evolved significantly since the original scripts were written
- Command syntax has changed, particularly for service creation and management
- New command structure: `railway add --service` instead of `railway service create --name`
- Variable setting now uses `railway variables --set "KEY=VALUE"` format

### Environment Configuration
- Environment variables must be explicitly set on both services independently
- WebSocket URL must be properly configured with `wss://` protocol in production
- Frontend needs proper environment variables to connect to the WebSocket server
- Production builds require explicit `NODE_ENV=production` setting

### Server Implementation
- Express server is required for serving static frontend content
- Static file server must redirect all routes to index.html for SPA routing
- Port configuration must match Railway's expectations (using `process.env.PORT`)
- Health check endpoints are essential for Railway service monitoring

### Frontend-WebSocket Coordination
- Frontend must be deployed after the WebSocket server to use the correct URL
- WebSocket server health endpoint (`/health`) provides valuable debugging information
- Environment variables must be propagated from deployment script to production environment
- Connection status component helps diagnose WebSocket connection issues

### Railway Service Management
- Multiple services in the same project can share environment variables if needed
- Custom domains are automatically provisioned for each service
- Services default to the same environment (`production`) within a project
- Service names should be descriptive to avoid confusion (e.g., `tiptap-frontend`, `websocket-server`)

## Deployment Architecture Decisions

### Separation of Concerns
- WebSocket server and frontend are deployed as separate services
- This allows independent scaling and monitoring of each component
- Enables separate deployment cycles if needed
- Provides clear separation for debugging and monitoring

### Express Server for Frontend
- Using Express instead of a simple static file server provides flexibility
- Enables proper SPA routing (redirecting all routes to index.html)
- Allows future API endpoints to be added if needed
- Provides better error handling and logging capabilities

### Environment Variable Strategy
- Critical environment variables are set explicitly during deployment
- WebSocket URL is determined dynamically when possible but can be overridden
- Development and production environments use different protocols (ws:// vs wss://)
- Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure the application works in various environments

### Deployment Script Improvements
- Added explicit error handling and validation
- Included build steps within deployment scripts for consistency
- Created specialized scripts for specific deployment scenarios
- Improved logging and visibility into the deployment process

## Future Improvements

### CI/CD Integration
- Scripts should be adapted for CI/CD pipelines
- GitHub Actions could automate the deployment process
- Environment variables should be stored securely in CI/CD secrets
- Deployment should be triggered by specific Git events (tags, branches)

### Enhanced Monitoring
- Add more detailed health checks for the WebSocket server
- Implement performance monitoring for WebSocket connections
- Create dashboards for real-time user activity
- Set up alerts for connection issues or errors

### Deployment Process Documentation
- Create step-by-step documentation for future deployments
- Include troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Add architecture diagrams explaining the deployment structure
- Document environment variable requirements and configuration options

### Security Enhancements
- Implement authentication for WebSocket connections
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure sensitive environment variables
- Implement CORS policies for production environments
