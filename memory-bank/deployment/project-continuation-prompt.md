# TipTap Collaborative Editor - Project Continuation Prompt

## Current Project Status
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel
- **WebSocket Server**: Deployment issues on Railway
- **Primary Challenge**: Resolving WebSocket server deployment and connection

## Specific Focus Areas
1. WebSocket Server Deployment
   - Multiple recent deployment failures
   - Need to diagnose and resolve deployment blockers
   - Verify server configuration and startup script

2. Connection Configuration
   - Verify WebSocket URL configuration
   - Implement robust connection logging
   - Test fallback mechanisms

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Consider unified Railway deployment
   - Review current multi-platform approach
   - Simplify deployment workflow

## Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Investigate recent WebSocket server deployment failures
- [ ] Verify Railway project and service configurations
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging to WebSocket server
- [ ] Test connection resilience and fallback mechanisms

## Key Questions to Address
1. Why are Railway deployments failing?
2. Is the WebSocket server configured correctly?
3. How can we improve deployment reliability?
4. What are the current connection challenges?

## Recommended Approach
1. Review deployment logs in detail
2. Add verbose logging to deployment scripts
3. Verify environment variable configurations
4. Test connection mechanisms manually
5. Consider restructuring for simplified deployment

## Context References
- Project Memory: `/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/tiptap-demo/memory-bank/`
- Deployment Scripts: `deploy-railway.sh`, `verbose-deploy.sh`
- Configuration Files: `railway.json`, `vercel.json`

## Debugging Resources
- Frontend WebSocket Service: `src/services/WebSocketService.ts`
- WebSocket Server: `websocket-server/server.js`

## Project Goals
- Create a robust collaborative TipTap editor
- Demonstrate advanced WebSocket and Y.js integration
- Prepare for Wordware job interview presentation

Suggested first action: Analyze recent deployment logs and configuration files to identify deployment blockers.
