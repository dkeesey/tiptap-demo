# TipTap Demo - Project Rules and Intelligence

## Code and Architecture Patterns

### React Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow a clear component hierarchy
- Keep components focused on single responsibilities
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and state

### TipTap Implementation
- Configure editor through extensions
- Create clear abstractions around the TipTap API
- Follow the "headless UI" paradigm
- Implement custom UI components for all editor controls

### Styling Approach
- Use TailwindCSS as the primary styling solution
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure responsive design across device sizes
- Use CSS variables for theming when appropriate

### State Management
- Use React context for editor state when necessary
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Minimize prop drilling
- Use local storage for document persistence

### Performance Practices
- Memoize components when appropriate
- Use virtualization for large documents
- Debounce expensive operations
- Lazy-load extensions and components when possible

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Usage
- Use proper typing for all components and functions
- Avoid 'any' type where possible
- Create interfaces for complex data structures
- Use type guards when necessary

### Component Guidelines
- Keep components focused and small
- Use composition over inheritance
- Extract repeated logic to custom hooks
- Document complex components

### Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for non-obvious functions
- Document key architectural decisions
- Keep the README up to date
- Document props for reusable components

### Testing
- For this demo, focus on manual testing
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Validate keyboard accessibility

## Project Management

### Time Management
- Focus on core functionality first
- Polish only after basics are working
- Assess feasibility of advanced features based on progress
- Allow time for testing and bug fixing

### Feature Prioritization
1. Core editor functionality
2. Clean, intuitive UI
3. Document persistence
4. Advanced editing features
5. Optional: Collaboration
6. Optional: AI integration

### Commit Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit frequently with focused changes
- Push regularly to backup work
- Keep the main branch stable

## Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Process
- Set up continuous deployment with Vercel
- Deploy early and often
- Use branch previews for testing changes
- Ensure proper configuration for production builds

### Environment Management
- Keep development and production environments consistent
- Use environment variables for configuration where needed
- Document any environment-specific settings

## Key Learnings and Insights

### TipTap Architecture
- TipTap is built on ProseMirror, a low-level editor toolkit
- The extension system is central to TipTap's architecture
- TipTap is "headless" - it provides functionality but no UI
- The React integration simplifies binding to React components

### Wordware Integration
- Wordware uses TipTap for collaborative editing of AI prompts
- TipTap's collaboration extensions are likely important to Wordware
- The demo should highlight features relevant to AI development

### Development Insights
- Start with the official examples and documentation
- Focus on understanding the extension system
- Pay attention to editor state management
- Implement features incrementally
