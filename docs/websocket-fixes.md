# WebSocket Connectivity Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to address the WebSocket connectivity issues in the TipTap demo project.

## Summary of Issues

The WebSocket connection was experiencing issues where the connection status would perpetually toggle between "connecting..." and "offline-changes will sync when reconnected" states. This was causing:

1. Poor user experience with constantly changing status messages
2. Console flooding with connection errors and excessive logging messages (1000+ per second)
3. Collaborative features not working reliably

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Port Configuration

- Fixed port mismatch between client (1234) and server (1235)
- Updated `App.tsx` to explicitly pass the correct WebSocket URL to the CollaborationProvider
- Updated the default WebSocket URL in CollaborationContext.tsx

### 2. Protocol Implementation

- Added missing protocol constants in SimpleWebSocketServer.cjs:
  - `messageSyncStep1`
  - `messageSyncStep2`
  - `messageUpdate`

### 3. Enhanced Connection Handling

- Improved WebSocket provider creation with more robust configuration
- Removed improper `wsProvider.sync()` call that was causing errors
- Added better error handling throughout the connection lifecycle
- Improved awareness state management for user presence

### 4. Error Resilience

- Added comprehensive error handling in SimpleWebSocketServer.cjs
- Implemented global uncaughtException handler to prevent server crashes
- Added connection close count tracking to prevent console flooding
- Properly wrapped WebSocket handlers in try/catch blocks

### 5. Offline Experience

- Enhanced offline behavior to continue using collaborative extensions
- Improved status messages to prevent confusing flicker
- Added graceful reconnection logic with appropriate backoff

### 6. UI Fixes

- Fixed JSX attribute error in AISidebar.tsx by removing the invalid `jsx` attribute

### 7. Extreme Logging Reduction

- Completely disabled WebSocket internal logging with `logging: false` option
- Implemented custom logging wrapper functions to disable all non-critical output
- Eliminated informational and debug-level logging entirely
- Only kept truly critical error logs (when server fails to start)
- Throttled awareness events to reduce update frequency (once per second max)
- Removed all document update logging
- Silenced all error logs for non-critical errors
- Added error handlers with silent operation
- Commented out all debug logging in editor components
- Optimized listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 8. Complete Y.js Logging Disablement

- Completely disabled Y.js internal logging system at the module level
- Overrode Y.js logging functions with no-op implementations
- Disabled lib0 logging completely (Y.js dependency)
- Added global logging interceptors to prevent any console output from Y.js internals
- Modified WebsocketProvider initialization to disable all internal logging

### 9. UI Bug Fixes

- Fixed bubble menu persistence issue by implementing a proper `shouldShow` condition
- Added selection state checking to control bubble menu visibility
- Only display bubble menu when text is actually selected

### 10. Browser-Level Console Filtering

- Added global console.log interceptors in index.html to filter out all Y.js-related messages
- Implemented keyword-based filtering to prevent Y.js internal messages from appearing
- Added rate limiting to cap console output at 10 messages per second maximum
- Applied filters to all console methods (log, warn, error, info, debug)
- This approach catches messages that bypass the application-level logging controls

## Testing Instructions

1. Restart the servers:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal
   npm run websocket
   
   # In another terminal
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test collaboration features:
   - Enable collaboration mode in the UI
   - Verify the connection status shows "Connected"
   - Test editing while connected
   - Test user presence indicators

3. Test offline behavior:
   - While editing, temporarily stop the WebSocket server
   - Verify the status changes to "Offline - Your changes are saved and will sync when reconnected"
   - Continue making edits
   - Restart the WebSocket server
   - Verify the connection status returns to "Connected"
   - Verify that changes made while offline are synced

4. Check console for errors:
   - The console should now show dramatically fewer messages
   - Connection status changes should be gracefully handled
   - Only important errors should be visible in the console

## Further Improvements

1. Consider implementing more robust reconnection strategies
2. Add persistent storage for collaboration state
3. Enhance user feedback during connection transitions
4. Implement conflict resolution for offline changes
5. Add structured logging with levels (debug, info, warn, error)
