# TipTap Demo Enhancement Plan: Mirroring Wordware's Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines our plan to enhance the TipTap demo to mirror Wordware's collaborative prompt engineering implementation. Wordware uses TipTap as the foundation for its collaborative IDE, providing a Notion-like interface that makes AI prompt engineering accessible to non-technical domain experts.

## Architecture

Our enhanced implementation consists of four primary layers:

### 1. Data Layer
- **Y.js documents** for collaborative editing (CRDT)
- **SyncedStore** for structured state management
- **Local storage persistence** for offline support

### 2. Collaboration Layer
- **WebSocket provider** for real-time syncing
- **Collaborative cursor tracking** to show who's editing what
- **User presence** indicators with avatars and names

### 3. Editor Layer
- **TipTap core** with essential extensions
- **Custom nodes** for AI prompts 
- **Slash command interface** for quick actions

### 4. UI Layer
- **Notion-like interface** with modern UI components
- **Connection status indicators** for online/offline state
- **Project structure management** for organizing prompts

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Collaboration Setup

**Dependencies to add:**
```bash
npm install yjs y-websocket @syncedstore/core @tiptap/extension-collaboration @tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor
```

**Key Components:**
1. **WebSocket Server** - Simple server to handle collaboration
2. **CollaborationContext** - React context for managing Y.js documents
3. **CollaborativeTiptapEditor** - Enhanced TipTap with collaboration extensions

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create collaboration server
2. Set up collaboration context
3. Enhance TipTap editor with collaboration extensions
4. Add basic user presence indicators

### Phase 2: Enhanced Collaboration Features

**Key Components:**
1. **User Profiles** - Names, colors, avatars
2. **Collaborative Cursors** - Visual indicators of where users are editing
3. **Connection Status** - Offline/online indicators
4. **Slash Command Interface** - "/" command menu for inserting blocks

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add user profile management
2. Implement collaborative cursors
3. Create connection status indicators
4. Develop slash command extension

### Phase 3: Prompt Engineering Interface

**Key Components:**
1. **AI Prompt Blocks** - Specialized node types for prompt sections
2. **Variables System** - Template variables for dynamic prompts
3. **Preview Capabilities** - Test prompts with sample inputs

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create custom node types for AI prompts
2. Implement variables system
3. Add preview/testing capabilities
4. Develop syntax highlighting for prompts

### Phase 4: Project Structure & UI Enhancements

**Key Components:**
1. **Document Management** - Multiple document support
2. **File/Folder Structure** - Organization capabilities
3. **UI Polish** - Complete Notion-like look and feel

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add document management features
2. Implement file/folder structure
3. Polish UI for a more Notion-like experience
4. Add keyboard shortcuts and performance optimizations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Collaboration Context

```typescript
// Essential structure for the collaboration context
interface CollaborationContextType {
  ydoc: Y.Doc;
  provider: WebsocketProvider;
  isOnline: boolean;
  connectionStatus: 'connected' | 'connecting' | 'disconnected';
  currentUser: User;
  connectedUsers: Map<number, User>;
  updateCurrentUser: (user: Partial<User>) => void;
}
```

### Slash Command Implementation

The slash command extension will provide a "/" menu for adding various blocks:
- Text blocks
- Headings
- Lists
- Prompt blocks
- Code blocks
- Variable references

### Collaborative Cursors

Using TipTap's CollaborationCursor extension, we'll display:
- Users' cursor positions
- Selected text highlighting
- User info on hover

### Offline Support

Leveraging Y.js's capabilities, our implementation will:
- Work offline without disruption
- Save changes locally
- Sync automatically when reconnected
- Resolve conflicts intelligently

## Future Enhancements

After completing the core implementation, we can consider:

1. **History/Versioning** - Track changes over time
2. **Comments System** - Add inline comments for feedback
3. **AI Integration** - Test prompts directly with various AI models
4. **Export Options** - Export prompts to various formats

## Progress Tracking

We'll track progress through GitHub issues and project board. Each phase will have its own milestone with specific deliverables.

## Conclusion

This plan provides a structured approach to enhancing our TipTap demo to mirror Wordware's implementation. By following this plan, we'll create a sophisticated collaborative prompt engineering interface that showcases the power of TipTap's extensible architecture and Y.js's collaboration capabilities.

## Key Learnings

- Wordware uses TipTap built on ProseMirror for their document editing
- They leverage Y.js for real-time collaboration
- SyncedStore provides an abstraction over Y.js for easier state management
- PartyKit serves as their collaboration backend
- A slash command interface provides a Notion-like UX
- The offline-first approach ensures resilience
