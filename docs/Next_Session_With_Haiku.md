# TipTap Demo - Next Session with Claude Haiku

## Session Goals

1. Apply Tailwind prose styling throughout the TipTap demo application
2. Explore MCP server management approaches aligned with CDT's development direction

## UI Enhancement Focus

1. Systematically apply Tailwind Typography (prose) classes to:
   - Editor content area
   - Application layout
   - Component styling (toolbars, menus, buttons)
   - Responsive design elements

2. Implement a cohesive, Notion-like aesthetic across the application

## MCP Management Strategy Considerations

Building on CDT's apparent approach to MCP server management through Docker containerization:

1. **Alignment with Platform Evolution**: 
   - Consider how our MCP approach can align with CDT's built-in support
   - Explore hybrid solutions that work with both Node.js and Docker-based MCPs

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Investigate memory footprint reduction for running multiple MCPs
   - Consider approaches that fit with CDT's containerization direction

3. **MCP Capability Manager Enhancement**:
   - Develop metadata structures that describe MCP requirements by project type
   - Create configurations that could work with both current Node.js approach and future Docker-based solutions

4. **Transition Planning**:
   - Design a path that allows gradual migration from current approach to platform-supported approach
   - Ensure backward compatibility while enabling future optimizations

## Technical Implementation Approach

1. Start with UI enhancements to prepare for tomorrow's presentation
2. Document MCP management insights for future implementation
3. Consider how the MCP Capability Manager project could interface with CDT's native Docker support

## Notes for Haiku Session

- Focus on practical implementation of UI enhancements first
- Craft a plan for MCP management aligned with platform direction
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
- Prioritize visual polish for the demo presentation
