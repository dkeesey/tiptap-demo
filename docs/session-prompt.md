# TipTap Demo Enhancement - Session Prompt

I'm working on enhancing a TipTap rich text editor demo to mirror Wordware's collaborative prompt engineering implementation. Wordware uses TipTap with Y.js for real-time collaboration and a Notion-like interface for AI prompt engineering.

## Current Status

We have a basic TipTap editor implementation with the following features:
- Rich text formatting (bold, italic, headings, lists, blockquotes)
- Editor toolbar with formatting options
- Bubble menu for selected text
- Floating menu for empty paragraphs
- Document persistence with localStorage
- Markdown import/export functionality

## Enhancement Plan

We're following a structured implementation plan (see `/docs/implementation-plan.md`) with four phases:
1. Core Collaboration Setup (Y.js, WebSocket, collaboration extensions)
2. Enhanced Collaboration Features (user presence, slash commands)
3. Prompt Engineering Interface (AI prompt blocks, variables)
4. Project Structure & UI Enhancements (document management, Notion-like UI)

## Resources

- Implementation Plan: `/docs/implementation-plan.md`
- Project Memory Bank: `/memory-bank/`
- Source Code: `/src/`

## Next Steps

Let's continue implementing the next phase of our enhancement plan. Please:

1. Review the current codebase to understand the existing implementation
2. Consult the implementation plan to identify the next steps
3. Help implement the required features, starting with the collaboration infrastructure
4. Provide clear explanations and documentation for any added code
5. Update the project memory bank with new learnings

Let's start by implementing the core collaboration features using Y.js and TipTap's collaboration extensions.
