# TipTap Demo Taskmaster

This project uses [taskmaster-ai](https://github.com/maxwelljoslyn/taskmaster-ai) to organize and track tasks based on the Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and implementation plans.

## Structure

The taskmaster configuration is organized as follows:

- `taskmaster.json`: Main configuration file
- `tasks/`: Directory containing task definitions
  - `ai-features.json`: AI integration features
  - `ui-enhancements.json`: UI and UX improvements
  - `debugging.json`: Bug fixes and debugging tools
  - `collaboration.json`: Collaborative editing features
  - `documentation.json`: Documentation and presentation materials

## Categories

Tasks are organized into the following categories:

1. **ai-features**: AI integration features for the editor
2. **ui-enhancements**: UI and UX improvements
3. **debugging**: Bug fixes and debugging tools
4. **collaboration**: Collaborative editing features
5. **documentation**: Documentation and presentation materials

## Task Status

Each task can have one of the following statuses:

- **todo**: Task has not been started
- **in-progress**: Task is currently being worked on
- **review**: Task is complete but needs review
- **done**: Task is complete and verified

## Priority Levels

Tasks are prioritized as follows:

- **low**: Nice to have, but not essential
- **medium**: Important but not urgent
- **high**: Critical for core functionality
- **critical**: Must be completed for project success

## How to Use

### Running Taskmaster

You can run taskmaster in several ways:

1. Using the script:
   ```bash
   ./run-taskmaster.sh
   ```

2. Using the npm script:
   ```bash
   npm run taskmaster
   ```

3. Running directly:
   ```bash
   npx task-master-ai
   ```

### Updating Tasks

To update a task status:

1. Open the corresponding JSON file in the `tasks/` directory
2. Find the task you want to update
3. Change the `status` field to one of the allowed values
4. Save the file
5. Run taskmaster to see the updated status

Alternatively, you can update tasks through the taskmaster interface.

### Adding New Tasks

To add a new task:

1. Open the appropriate JSON file in the `tasks/` directory
2. Add a new task object following the existing structure
3. Make sure to give it a unique `id`
4. Save the file
5. Run taskmaster to see the new task

## Implementation Plan

Based on the PRDs and task structure, follow this implementation approach:

1. First, complete the high-priority debugging tasks to ensure a stable foundation
2. Implement AI features according to the defined tasks
3. Enhance UI and collaboration features
4. Prepare documentation and presentation materials

## Deadlines

All tasks are scheduled to be completed by April 27, 2025, with priority given to:

1. AI Features (April 25-26, 2025)
2. Bug Fixes and Improvements (April 27, 2025)
3. Documentation and Presentation (April 27, 2025)

## Integration with Development Workflow

Taskmaster helps maintain focus on implementation priorities defined in the PRDs:

1. Use it daily to track progress
2. Update task statuses as you complete work
3. Prioritize work based on task priorities
4. Ensure all high-priority tasks are completed before the deadline

## Presentation Preparation

When preparing for the Wordware presentation on April 28, 2025:

1. Make sure all critical tasks are completed
2. Verify that all features defined in the PRDs are implemented
3. Test all functionality thoroughly
4. Prepare documentation and presentation materials
5. Practice demonstrating the key features
